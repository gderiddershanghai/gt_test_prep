    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 1**  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** E  \n",
    "**Explanation:** A decentralized supply chain is suitable when there are many points of sale, allowing inventory to be located closer to customers. This improves service levels and reduces delivery times.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 2**  \n",
    "**Correct Answers:** A, D  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "- A centralized strategy aligns with efficiency: fewer facilities, lower inventory, and scale economies.  \n",
    "- A decentralized strategy supports responsiveness: localized inventory and quicker customer service.  \n",
    "Other options confuse strategy-supply chain alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 3**  \n",
    "**Correct Answers:** A, B, C, D  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "See self assessment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 4**  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** C  \n",
    "**Explanation:** Real estate costs are typically fixed and domestic, not a major factor in offshoring decisions. Other options reflect variable and international-specific cost elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 5**  \n",
    "**Correct Answers:** A,B, D  \n",
    "**Explanation:** Centralized supply chains are ideal when demand is predictable and distribution complexity is low. This allows fewer facilities to serve broad areas efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 6**  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** A  \n",
    "**Explanation:** Although exchange rate fluctuations impact cost, the course classifies them under *Political and Macroeconomic Drivers*, not *Cost Drivers*. Falling communication costs, while reducing costs, are still categorized under cost drivers due to their direct influence on feasibility.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Correct Answers:** A, C, E  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Responsive supply chains are designed for environments with:\n",
    "- **Rapid shifts in customer preferences** (A)  \n",
    "- **Short product lifecycles** (C)  \n",
    "- **High forecast uncertainty** (E)  \n",
    "These conditions require flexibility, speed, and adaptability. Cost efficiency (B) and minimal customization (D) align more with efficient or lean models.\n",

    "- **Multiple regions require tailored delivery** (B)  \n",
    "- **Products are time-sensitive** (D)  \n",
    "- **Demand is erratic and localized** (E)  \n",
    "Long lead times (A) contradict decentralization logic, and low transport cost per unit (C) favors centralization due to economies of scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 9**  \n",
    "**Correct Answers:** A, C, D  \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 10**  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** C  \n",

    "Centralized networks are:\n",
    "- Cost-efficient (A, B),  \n",
    "- Easier to control (D),  \n",
    "but **not** highly responsive to **local market fluctuations** (C) due to geographic and logistical lag.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 11**  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** B  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "**Exchange rate volatility** (B) is a hidden financial cost that can unpredictably erode offshoring gains. Other choices are either domestic costs or not hidden (like known logistics costs).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 12**  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** D  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Offshoring **core competencies** may reduce internal expertise, innovation capacity, and strategic differentiation. That **weakens long-term competitive strength** (D).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 13**  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** C  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Centralized supply chains emphasize:\n",
    "- **Efficiency** (C) through inventory pooling, scale economies, and standardization.  \n",
    "They are less suited to responsiveness or agility.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The best strategic match is:\n",
    "- **Innovative product → Responsive supply chain** (C)  \n",

    "### **Question 15**  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** C. Critical fractile based on overage and underage cost  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The newsvendor model determines the optimal one-time order quantity based on balancing the **cost of overstocking (CO)** and **understocking (CU)**. This balance is captured in the **critical fractile**:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Critical Fractile} = \\frac{CU}{CU + CO}\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "This ratio directly determines the service level and optimal order quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 16**  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** C. Shortages are allowed  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The basic EOQ model **does not** allow shortages. It assumes:\n",
    "- Constant demand  \n",
    "- Instantaneous replenishment  \n",
    "- No stockouts  \n",
    "- Cost focus only on ordering and holding  \n",
    "Allowing shortages would require a modified model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 17**  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** B. EOQ decreases  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The EOQ formula is:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2DS}{H}}\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "If holding cost ($H$) increases, the denominator increases, causing the EOQ value to decrease. This means firms should order smaller quantities more frequently when it becomes more expensive to hold inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 18**  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** B. Holding and ordering  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "EOQ is derived by minimizing the **sum** of:\n",
    "- **Ordering costs** (cost incurred per order placed)  \n",
    "- **Holding costs** (cost to carry inventory over time)  \n",
    "Other costs like shrinkage, spoilage, or transportation are excluded in the basic EOQ model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 19**  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** C. Because excess inventory is kept to avoid stockouts  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Achieving a 100% fill rate requires **buffering against all demand uncertainty**, which leads to carrying large amounts of safety stock. This increases **holding costs** significantly and is typically not optimal in cost-sensitive environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 20**  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** A. It represents the lost margin on a missed sale  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "In a newsvendor setting, the **underage cost (CU)** is calculated as the **contribution margin lost** when demand exceeds inventory. This is approximated as:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "CU = \\text{Retail Price} - \\text{Wholesale Cost}\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "It reflects the opportunity cost of failing to meet demand.\n"

    "### Question 24  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** C. To produce only when there is downstream demand  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Pull systems are demand-driven. Production is triggered by actual consumption downstream to minimize excess inventory and overproduction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 25  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** False  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Pull systems aim to minimize inventory by producing only in response to demand. Push systems typically hold more inventory to buffer uncertainty.  \n",

    "**Correct Answer:** C. Producing at the rate of customer demand  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Question 27  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** True  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Push systems are forecast-driven and can result in overproduction, leading to higher inventory and associated holding costs.  \n",

    "### Question 28  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** C. Running a time-limited discount  \n",

    "**Correct Answer:** B. Increases it  \n",
