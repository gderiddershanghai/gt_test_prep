    "### **Question 1**  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** E  \n",
    "**Explanation:** A decentralized supply chain is suitable when there are many points of sale, allowing inventory to be located closer to customers. This improves service levels and reduces delivery times.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Question 2**  \n",
    "**Correct Answers:** A, D  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "- A centralized strategy aligns with efficiency: fewer facilities, lower inventory, and scale economies.  \n",
    "- A decentralized strategy supports responsiveness: localized inventory and quicker customer service.  \n",

    "### **Question 3**  \n",
    "**Correct Answers:** B, C  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "- Exchange rate volatility adds financial risk, impacting cost predictability.  \n",
    "- Loss of control over quality and cost is a common issue with remote vendors.  \n",
    "Options A and D are less directly cited in the course as primary pitfalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 4**  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** C  \n",
    "**Explanation:** Real estate costs are typically fixed and domestic, not a major factor in offshoring decisions. Other options reflect variable and international-specific cost elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 5**  \n",
    "**Correct Answers:** A, D  \n",
    "**Explanation:** Centralized supply chains are ideal when demand is predictable and distribution complexity is low. This allows fewer facilities to serve broad areas efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 6**  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** A  \n",
    "**Explanation:** Although exchange rate fluctuations impact cost, the course classifies them under *Political and Macroeconomic Drivers*, not *Cost Drivers*. Falling communication costs, while reducing costs, are still categorized under cost drivers due to their direct influence on feasibility.\n",
